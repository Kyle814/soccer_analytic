In 2022, the global soccer market was valued at US$ 3.2 Billion (Football Market). This industry continues to grow exponentially every year. Matter of fact, the continued participation and viewing of professional sports subconsciously raises awarness about the benfits of physical activites and self care in daily life. Since these soccer leagues and teams have such passionate fans, they want to have the best team (made up of individual players) possible in order to satisfty fans and club investors.

To that end, we will be answering the following 4 questions using several types of analyses:

- *Answered through descriptive analysis:* What is the relationship between a soccer players position and their value (EUR) in this dataset? Furthermore, how does this relationship between a soccer players position and their value (EUR) change for different values of minutes played?


- *Answered through inference:* Is there a difference between the player value of French & Spanish Players and all other players? 


- *Answered through linear regression:* Is there a linear relationship between the number of shots, height, passes blocked, and passes completed with the value of a player?


- *Answered through logistic regression:* Is there a linear relationship between the log odds of the success level of players being worth more than 20 million euros in value, and goals, assists, touches, minutes, and passes completed? What about for the population of all professional soccer players? What explanatory variables should we include in the model to build a parsimonious model?


To answer these questions will allow the soccer industry (teams/scouts/fans) to identify what impacts the value of a player and what is most important when analysing players. It can also help tell whether a target player is currently over or undervalued and what price they should be willing to pay for a player of that quality.
